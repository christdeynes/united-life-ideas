#### What is your app? For what purpose was your app created?
Peter: It is designed for ones without any knowledge of simple life skills and how to do them step-by-step.
Karla: Our app is where anyone who doesn't know how to cook eggs, change a tire, or even tie a tie can come to our website and learn how to do those things with simple steps that isn't to long and won't bore the person and can easily understand it.
William - "Don't know how to tie a tie, cook sunny side eggs, or even do your own laundry? Our website is made for you. As long as you know how to use a computer, our website has step-by-step to help teach teens and adults around of age of 16 to 25 to learn simple life skills to help teach you certain topics such as fixing and checking parts of your car, taking care of yourself around the house, keeping track of your finance, and getting ready for your first job!"

#### What local/world problem is your app working to solve?
Peter: To educate people of basic life skills that everyone should know how to do.

William - "The issue we are trying to solve is that most teens and adults around the age of 16 to 25 don't know how to simple things such as tie a tie or changing a tire. We are working to solve it with this app by explain those topics. 

Karla: Our app is trying to solve the problem that young people face when they come in contact with things they have no idea how to do,we take those skills and break them down to where people can understand.



#### Include your mission statement
"Where People Can Come To Learn Basic Skills ThatWill Prove Useful In Everyday Life."


## Development & Design
#### Describe your personal involvement in creating the app
Peter: I was involved in the foundation.

Karla: I was involved on creating the lay out forthe how to's.

Willim - "I am involved in the creation of the sidebar, the categories pages, and the groups logo."


#### What development and/or design work were you responsible for contributing?
Peter: Particulary the About Us page and also some of the life skills guides.

Karla- At the begining i made the sub categories page, where it list all the automotive things or home things depending on what you click on. I then started creating the steps that are listed on one of the how to's. I also did a lot of styling with Will we decided on the colors that we would use and the fonts we used for the page.I also came up with the logo for our group and Will drew it out much better.

William - "Like Karla, together we did most of the styling. I created the sidebar to link all of the pages together, as well as the categories page holding all of the topics with a picture to go with it. I am also the designer for the final draft of the logo which is found on the homepage which couldn't be done without the help of Karla."

#### Is there anything that you did not have the time/ resources to develop for your app but that you are still working towards? (aka the opposite of MVP)
Peter: For sure the individual life skills guides.

Karla: I would have liked to work more on the design of the page and the color also doing more of the how to's.

William - "I would have liked to work a bit more on the sidebar, add the ability to create accounts, and add more design to the website."


#### Problems you and/or your group ran into and how you all solved them
Peter: A lot of interference with GitHub, multiple people being involved on the same page that may have interfered with organization.


## Wrap Up
#### What you took away from the experience
Karla: What I took away from this experience is a new way to look at websiite and you don't have to know everything about computers in order to do code. I was able to learn something that never in my life would I have thought that I would be able to do and continue to do it hopefully as I grow up.

William - "From this class, I learned the basics to websites and how they are developed. I learned how to make html, ccs, and a little bit of java script."

Peter: What I took away from this class was more experience in a group-environment and also coding experience in general. I was somewhat experienced but I think that this has opened up a whole 'nother world.

#### What you learned and why that lesson was valuable
Karla: I learned how to design a wesite and how to start the layout of a webpage it was valuable because our generatiuon is moving into technology and being able to have a job or even an opportunity that deals with something you enjoy doing is beyond amazing.

William - "From the class I learned how to make html, css, and java script. This is vauable because this can be used to show employers that we have experience in the field to find jobs easier."

Peter: I learned mostly about classes and much about functions. I'm not interested in entering the workforce with this coding experience, though I think that this has tought me more about general reasoning.

#### Thank you for listening! Are there any questions?
