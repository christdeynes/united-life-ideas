        <h5>United Life Skills is a website, created through a small team of four through the South Bend Community School Corporation enrolled with Code School, partnered with Notre Dame. The process pursued by us is always in the making, but took four weeks collectively with Code School. The website was crteated with HTML, CSS, and also Java. Many processes were used such as using classes, divs, materializing, and much more.</h5>
