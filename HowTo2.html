        How To Change a Flat Tire
      </h1>
    </div>

    <ol>
      <li> Find a safe location to ensure you are not injured and do not cause an accident.</li>
      <li> Turn on your hazard lights to alert other drivers.</li>
      <li> Apply the parking brake to keepyour vehicle from moving.</li>
      <li> Apply tire wedges or another object to further ensure that your vehicle does not move.</li>
      <li> Remove any hubcap or wheel cover to expose the lug nuts holding the wheel in place.</li>
      <li> Use a tire iron to loosen the lug nuts, but do not completely remove them.</li>
      <li> Place a jack under the vehicle. Try to place it under the frame of the car near the tire for the best support.</li>
      <li> Pump the jack and lift the car off the ground.</li>
      <li> Finish removing the lug nuts.</li>
      <li> Pull the flat tire off of the vehicle.</li>
      <li> Place the spare tire on the lug bolts by lining up the holes in the rim with the bolts and gently pushing the rim all the way on.</li>
      <li> Tighten the lug nuts by hand before lowering the vehicle.</li>
      <li> Lower the vehicle most of the way to the ground by releasing the jack and tighten the lug nuts with the tire iron.</li>
      <li> Lower the vehicle completely.</li>
      <li> Replace any hubcaps or tire covers.</li>
      <li> Stow all equipment.</li>
      <li> Check the air pressure in the spare tire.</li>
      <li> Take the flat tire to a technician. Spare tires aren't made to go long distances or at high speeds, so drive carefully.</li>
